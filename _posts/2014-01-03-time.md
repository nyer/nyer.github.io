title: What is time?
---

We cannot touch it, feel it, but we rely on it. If there is no time, the world will fall into disorder.
We use time as a metric to measure how old we are, duration something lasts, 
and we are used to it as if it is fortune of our own.
However, We treat it as if it does not exists such as the air. Most people breath without worry that the air will be in shortage.
But the time is not the air, it is a illusion and it is limited.
